# 🫧 Interactive Bubble App – Mastering DOM Manipulation

The **Interactive Bubble App** is a beginner-friendly yet engaging project built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. Designed to provide hands-on experience with **DOM (Document Object Model)** manipulation, this application dynamically generates interactive bubbles that users can click to pop, offering a visual and functional understanding of real-time DOM operations.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Demonstrate practical use of DOM APIs.
- Enable interactive UI elements with JavaScript.
- Strengthen understanding of event-driven programming.
- Showcase dynamic styling and layout manipulation.

## 🧠 Key Learnings

By exploring this project, developers can grasp:

- DOM tree structure and traversal
- Dynamic creation and insertion of HTML elements
- Event listeners and real-time interaction
- Randomized element styling and positioning
- Real-time state updates (e.g., scoring system)
- Use of `setInterval`/`setTimeout` for controlled behavior

## 🧩 Features

- 🎨 Randomized bubble colors, sizes, and positions
- 🖱️ Pop bubbles on click and track score
- ⚡ Real-time DOM manipulation
- ⏱️ Optional: Add timers, sound effects, and levels for gamification

---

## 🔍 How It Works

- **Bubble Generation**: JavaScript dynamically creates `div` elements styled as bubbles, randomly positioned on the screen.
- **Event Binding**: Each bubble listens for click events; when triggered, it’s removed from the DOM and the score increments.
- **UI Update**: The score is continuously displayed and updated without refreshing the page.
